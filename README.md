### LiveSplit and Game Time
 
If you want to compare your splits against Game Time:
**Right click on LiveSplit's window -> Compare Against -> Game Time**

### Alternate Timing Method
   If you want to display both Game Time and Real Time in your layout, I suggest getting the Alternate Timing Method component     from [LiveSplit's website](http://livesplit.org/components/) or from its own [GitHub page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
