Features
--------
* Display the game time of the currently loaded save.
* [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org) autosplitter: game time, automatic start and reset.

Settings
--------
   You can access the settings by right clicking the main window. 

LiveSplit
---------
To have this program interact with [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org) you need the [LiveSplit Server](http://livesplit.org/components/) component to be installed and running. Download it [here](http://livesplit.org/components/).

Add the server to your LiveSplit layout. Then to start it, right click anywhere on LiveSplit's window and choose **Control -> Start Server**. The server needs to be started manually everytime you launch LiveSplit.

_Dying Light IGT_'s window title will indicate if it is connected to LiveSplit.

### LiveSplit and Game Time
 
If you want to compare your splits against Game Time:
**Right click on LiveSplit's window -> Compare Against -> Game Time**

### Alternate Timing Method
   If you want to display both Game Time and Real Time in your layout, I suggest getting the Alternate Timing Method component     from [LiveSplit's website](http://livesplit.org/components/) or from its own [GitHub page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
